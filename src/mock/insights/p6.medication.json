  "explanation": "Unable to perform medication safety review due to lack of medication information. Essential data needed includes: Complete home medication list with dosages and frequencies, over-the-counter medications and supplements, medication allergy history with type of reaction, current hospital medications and orders, recent medication changes or discontinuations, barriers to medication adherence (cost, complexity, understanding), and renal/hepatic function for dose adjustments. Without medication data, cannot assess for drug interactions, inappropriate medications, or adherence issues. Medication reconciliation must be completed as a patient safety priority.",
