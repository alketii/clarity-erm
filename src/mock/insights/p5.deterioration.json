  "title": "Clinical Deterioration Risk",
  "riskLevel": "High",
  "factors": [
    "Persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy",
    "Tachycardia with heart rates 92-100 bpm",
    "Elevated white blood cell count (13.5)",
    "Worsening renal function (creatinine 1.8)",
    "Low hemoglobin (10.5) suggesting anemia"
  ],
  "explanation": "Patient demonstrates high risk for clinical deterioration. Persistent fever and tachycardia despite 48+ hours of antibiotics raises concern for treatment failure or complications. Worsening renal function may indicate sepsis or volume depletion. Anemia combined with infection increases risk. Recommend: repeat chest imaging to assess for complications, blood cultures if not already done, consider ICU-level monitoring, nephrology consult for acute kidney injury, and broadening antibiotic coverage if no improvement.",
